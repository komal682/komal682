##  Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Highlights |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Producer-Consumer-Performance-Analysis** | A C-based deep dive into the classic producer-consumer problem with performance benchmarks. | Explores concurrency and throughput optimization. |
| **Mini_Shell** | A simplified shell implemented in C++, demonstrating command parsing, execution, and basic shell utilities. | Great for understanding shells, piping, and redirections. |
| **Wifi_simulator** | C++ project simulating WiFi scenariosâ€”possibly modeling latency or packet behavior. | Useful for networking insights and simulation logic. |
| **DeathStarBench** | Lua-based use of microservices benchmarking suite; a load testing and performance evaluation tool. | Great exposure to scalable architectures and benchmarking. |
